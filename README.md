# CrayonCode-BDO-Project
research project to learn autoit

Run CrayonCode_Fishing.au3 to start the script.

Requirements:

BDO EU (or EN/DE/FR client language)
Default BDO Font
100% UI Scale (UI Settings ingame)
Works in Fullscreen and Windowed Mode (If the text is a little blurry in windowed just use fullscreen instead)

Discussion and older versions with more features can be found at https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/black-desert/4268940-autoit-crayoncode-bot-project-opensource-free.html

Run CrayonCode_Processing.au3 to start the script.

IMPORTANT:
Storage auto-arrange must be turned ON.
Inventory auto-arrange must be turned OFF with the first 4 inventory slots EMPTY.
Always remember to SAVE settings after any changes otherwise they won't apply!
For custom processing, use round numbers for BATCH and MAX. Basically the bot will do #MAX of #BATCH items. So if MAX was 100, and BATCH was 10, it will do 10 rounds of 10 items.
For example: You have 3651 Birch Lumber, BATCH would be 500, MAX 3500. 

This feature is still under development and might cause some issues.

For STEEL you have to use the custom processing function and select Coal as ingredient 1 and Melted Iron Shard as ingredient 2.

Any issues please report.
